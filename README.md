Dotinator is an in-memory matrix dot product calculator. Inspired by the analog in-memory dot product calculator and problems with the self-attention model, this digital version is an experiment on how in-memory matrix dot product can optimize the process, the size and cost for this boost, and if the boost is worth the effort (probably not but well its fun to do random stuff).

I was going to submit this for the challenge but kinda started late and didn't have time to finish it up. Probably should have made up my mind sooner, did the same thing last challenge too ðŸ«£, and was going back and forth between a few other ideas before settling on this one.

I'm like this cat from my dad's factory:

No, I don't know its name, I only got the dogs but this cat just likes to sleep under our trees ðŸ‘€
